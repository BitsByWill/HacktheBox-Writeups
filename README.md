# HacktheBox Writeups

**Which writeups are here?**

I only make writeups for challenges/boxes that I find challenging or interesting.  They will all be protected with the challenge/root flag and will eventually be released onto my blog.  Some will also be hosted on my team (TCLRed) [site](https://thecybergeek.co.uk/).  This repo is meant so share techniques and alternative solutions with those who have solved these challenges/machines.  Feel free to contact my HTB account [will135](https://www.hackthebox.eu/profile/89875) if you have any questions.

**Disclaimer**

Do not leak the writeups here without their flags. If I detect misuse, it will be reported to HTB.  I also will not be responsible for any misuse of these writeups.
